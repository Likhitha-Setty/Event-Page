  <h1>Introverts?</h1>
  <p>
Because they don't solicit attention in the same way a dog does, many people assume that cats are anti-social loners. That couldn't be further from the truth. Cats actually thrive on interaction with their chosen humans. In fact some cats even like making new friends and socializing.</p><br>
<p>Much like people, cats have individual personalities. Some love spending time with people, and others would prefer hanging out in their favorite hiding spot when you have guests over. Sharing your home with a shy or introverted cat can be tricky if you are someone with an active social life.</p>

<h1>Breeds</h1>
<p>1.Exotic Shorthair cats:</p>
<p>For the third year in a row, the Exotic cat has been named as America's most popular registered cat, knocking the Persian off the podium again after 31 years as the reigning No. 1 breed.</p><br>

<p>2.Ragdoll Cats:</p>

 <p>3.British Shorthair:</p>
  <p>Not only is it one of the most popular cat breeds, it is also commonly selected to appear on TV, in movies and even in books. You might recognize the cat in many Whiskas brand ads as a British shorthair.</p><br>

<h1>Fun</h1>
<p>Cats love a stimulating environment. Cats need a variety of toys, including those they can play with on their own (for while you're at work) and those that you can use to play with them. And a window perch is a great place for your kitty to nap or watch birds and squirrels.</p><br>
